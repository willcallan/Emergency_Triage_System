Do not use deployment files in this directory, go to app/docker directories for db, back-end, and front-end deployments.  

**IMPORTANT**
Before using the app, navigate to localhost:5000/generate locally or https://apps.hdap.gatech.edu/emergency-department-triage-system-api/generate  
to create demo data and ensure the public FHIR server matches the db.
